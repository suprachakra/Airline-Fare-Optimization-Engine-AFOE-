## Global Configuration Files
This folder contains global configuration files and templates for different environments (development, staging, production). It includes:
- A sample composite configuration file (`config.sample.yaml`) that contains settings for all services.
- Example environment variable files (`dev.env.example`, `prod.env.example`).
- Global logging configuration (`logging.conf`).
- Audit policy definitions (`audit_policy.yaml`).

These files serve as a reference and starting point to configure the environment for local development, testing, and production deployments.
