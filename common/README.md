## Common Libraries and Shared Components
This folder contains common libraries, shared models, utility functions, constants, and API definitions that are used by multiple microservices in the Airline Fare Optimization Engine project. These modules ensure consistency, reduce code duplication, and centralize cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, configuration management, and error handling.

### Contents
- **models/**: Shared domain models and schema definitions.
- **utils/**: Common utility modules (logging, auth, configuration, error handling).
- **constants/**: Shared constant definitions (roles, metric names, etc.).
- **libraries/**: Documentation for any third-party or internal libraries vendored or shared with the project.
- **api/**: API interface definitions for both external and internal communication.

All components are designed to be robust, fully automated, and rigorously validated, ensuring zero manual intervention is required to maintain quality.
