## 01_Executive_Summary_and_Vision
The Dynamic Fare Adjustment Engine (DFAE) is a fully automated, data-driven platform designed to optimize airline fares in real time. By leveraging advanced machine learning, real-time data ingestion, and seamless integration with critical airline systems (such as Amadeus PSS, PROS O&D, pricing tools, ancillary merchandising, and network planning systems), DFAE maximizes revenue per seat mile, enhances customer trust through transparency, and drives operational efficiency.

### Problem Statement
Airlines face several challenges:
- **Revenue Maximization:** Legacy pricing models are static, resulting in lost revenue during high-demand periods and unsold seats during low-demand periods.
- **Customer Trust:** Customers demand clear, transparent pricing and personalized offers; opaque pricing leads to mistrust.
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual fare adjustments are slow, error-prone, and incapable of responding to real-time market fluctuations.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Maintaining 100% compliance with global data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PDPA) is complex when handling vast data volumes.

### Vision Statement
To set the industry benchmark for airline fare optimization by providing a real-time, fully automated pricing solution that maximizes revenue, enhances customer loyalty, and achieves operational excellence—all with complete transparency and regulatory compliance.

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to empower airlines with a cutting-edge Dynamic Fare Adjustment Engine that leverages advanced analytics and seamless integrations with external systems. This engine optimizes fares in real time, dynamically bundles ancillary services, and delivers personalized offers—driving revenue growth and superior customer experiences without manual intervention.
