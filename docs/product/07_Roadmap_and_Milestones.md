# Roadmap and Milestones

This roadmap outlines an 18‑month plan for DFAE, broken into 2‑sprint (4‑week) intervals. Each row specifies the timeframe, phase, objectives, integrated epics, teams involved, dependencies, sprint goals, deliverables, SAFe milestones, risks & mitigations, and expected outcomes. Every detail has been planned with zero manual intervention required for routine monitoring and gap resolution.

> **Note:** All details are based on data-driven, research-backed assumptions and cross‑functional reviews (Product, Design, Marketing, Engineering, Data, QA, Legal, Operations). Each risk is preemptively mitigated using automated systems.
