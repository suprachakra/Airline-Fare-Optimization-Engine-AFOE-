## Epics and Strategic Alignment
This document details the major epics that will drive the development of DFAE, aligning each epic with our strategic objectives and OKRs. Each epic is broken down into key features, and risks are identified along with mitigation strategies.

### Epics Overview Table

| Epic ID | Epic Name                         | Description                                                      | Key Features                                        | Risks & Mitigation                                         | OKR Alignment          |
|---------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| EPIC-1  | Real-Time Dynamic Pricing         | Develop the core dynamic pricing engine that adjusts fares in real time. | ML-based pricing engine, rules engine, API endpoints | Data delays: fallback caching and automated retries; model drift: continuous retraining | OKR-1, OKR-3           |
| EPIC-2  | Demand Forecasting Integration    | Integrate robust demand forecasting to predict passenger load factors and guide pricing. | Forecast models, automated retraining, real-time API | Forecast inaccuracies: fallback to statistical averages; latency: optimized data pipelines | OKR-1, OKR-3           |
| EPIC-3  | Ancillary and Merchandising       | Develop dynamic bundling of ancillary services with base fares to maximize non-ticket revenue. | Ancillary bundling engine, personalization module, pricing adjustments | Integration challenges: circuit breakers; personalization errors: A/B testing and fallback to base offers | OKR-5, OKR-2           |
| EPIC-4  | Offer Management and Personalization | Assemble complete offers (fare + ancillaries) with personalized adjustments for each customer. | Offer assembler, personalization engine, API gateway | Complexity: modular design; data integration: standardized formats and automated validations | OKR-2, OKR-3           |
| EPIC-5  | External Systems Integration      | Seamlessly integrate with Amadeus PSS, PROS O&D, Pricing Tools, and Network Planning systems. | API adapters, data normalization, secure data exchange, real-time sync | API failures: robust error handling; data inconsistency: automated validations and fallbacks | OKR-3, OKR-4           |
| EPIC-6  | Regulatory and Compliance Automation | Implement continuous compliance and audit mechanisms across the system. | Automated audit trails, real-time compliance monitoring, data anonymization | Regulatory shifts: dynamic config updates; security breaches: continuous vulnerability scans | OKR-4                   |
| EPIC-7  | Scalability and Resilience Enhancements | Ensure the system scales seamlessly and remains resilient under high load conditions. | Auto-scaling, failover mechanisms, performance monitoring | Underperformance: load balancing, automated scaling tests; downtime: multi-zone deployments | OKR-6, OKR-3           |
| EPIC-8  | Market Expansion and Competitive Differentiation | Leverage DFAE to capture new market segments and outpace competitors. | New promotional modules, targeted dynamic offers, market analytics dashboard | Customer confusion: enhanced UX and clear communications; channel conflicts: cross-functional alignment | OKR-7, OKR-2           |
