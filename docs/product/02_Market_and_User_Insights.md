## Market and User Insights

### Market Research Overview
The airline industry is transforming rapidly due to digital innovation, intense competition, and evolving customer expectations. Key findings include:
- **Dynamic Pricing Potential:** Dynamic pricing models can deliver a 3–10% revenue uplift per seat mile by leveraging real-time market data.
- **Ancillary Revenue Opportunity:** Intelligent bundling of ancillaries (e.g., baggage, seat upgrades, in-flight services) can boost non-ticket revenue by 10–15%.
- **Customer Expectations:** Modern travelers demand transparency, personalized offers, and immediate responses.
- **Competitive Landscape:** Legacy pricing systems are unable to respond in real time, leaving significant market gaps for advanced, automated pricing solutions.
