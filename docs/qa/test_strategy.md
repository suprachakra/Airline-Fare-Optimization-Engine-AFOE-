## Test Strategy
This document details our comprehensive testing strategy for DFAE to ensure high-quality and reliable system performance.

### Testing Levels:
1. **Unit Testing:**  
   - Scope: Test individual functions and methods in isolation.
   - Tools: pytest, JUnit, or similar, achieving >90% coverage.
2. **Integration Testing:**  
   - Scope: Test interactions between modules and services (APIs, data pipelines).
   - Tools: Postman, custom integration scripts.
3. **Performance Testing:**  
   - Scope: Load testing, stress testing, and scalability tests.
   - Tools: JMeter, Locust.
4. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**  
   - Scope: Simulate real user journeys (booking flows, dashboard usage).
   - Tools: Selenium, Cypress.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Automated Tests:** Must run in CI/CD pipelines on every commit.
- **Performance Metrics:** Response time <200ms under load; system uptime of 99.9%.
- **Regression:** No critical bugs in each release.

*Continuous integration and automated testing ensure that our system meets all functional and non-functional requirements without human intervention during production.*
