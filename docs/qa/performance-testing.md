## Performance Testing Strategy
This document details our approach to performance testing DFAE, ensuring the system scales under load and maintains a high level of responsiveness.

### Testing Objectives:
- **Load Testing:** Validate that the system can handle 500+ requests per second without degradation.
- **Stress Testing:** Identify the system's breaking point and ensure graceful degradation.
- **Scalability Testing:** Confirm that the auto-scaling mechanism works as expected across different environments.

### Tools and Metrics:
- **Tools:** JMeter, Locust for performance testing; Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- **Metrics:**  
  - Average response time (target: <200ms).  
  - System uptime (target: 99.9%).  
  - Error rates (target: <1%).
  
### Process:
- **Baseline Test:** Establish performance benchmarks on the development environment.
- **Continuous Testing:** Integrate performance tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed reports and dashboard visualizations to monitor trends over time.

*Regular performance testing ensures that DFAE remains robust and efficient even under peak loads.*
