## Automated Tests Documentation
This document outlines our automated testing framework, detailing how tests are structured, executed, and integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.

### Frameworks & Tools:
- **Languages:** Python (pytest), JavaScript (Jest/Mocha for front-end).
- **CI/CD Integration:** Tests run automatically via GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Coverage:** Aim for >90% test coverage across all modules.

### Test Types:
- **Unit Tests:** Validate individual functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Test API calls and service interactions.
- **Performance Tests:** Monitor load and stress responses.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate complete user flows to verify system behavior.

### Execution:
- Tests are executed on every push to the repository.
- Results are aggregated and reported; failures trigger automated rollback and alerts.

*Automated tests guarantee that every change is validated and any potential issues are resolved before deployment.*
