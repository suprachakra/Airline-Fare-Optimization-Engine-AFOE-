## PROS O&D Integration
This document explains how DFAE integrates with the PROS O&D system for demand forecasting and route analytics.

### Integration Details:
- **Data Inputs/Outputs:**  
  - Receives historical and real-time demand data, load factors, and route performance metrics.
- **Sync Frequency:**  
  - Data is synchronized every 5â€“10 minutes to ensure real-time accuracy.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implements data validation and fallback to historical averages in case of API failures.
- **Security:**  
  - Uses secure channels with API keys and encrypted data transmission.

*This integration feeds critical demand signals into our dynamic pricing algorithms.*
