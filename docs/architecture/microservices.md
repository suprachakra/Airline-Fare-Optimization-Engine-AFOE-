## Microservices Detailed Overview
This document details each microservice within DFAE, describing its role, internal components, and interactions with other services. The design ensures modularity, resilience, and full automation.

### Microservices Breakdown

#### Pricing Service
- **Role:** Calculate dynamic fares using real-time data.
- **Components:**
  - **DynamicPricingEngine:** Uses ML models and historical data to compute optimal fares.
  - **RulesEngine:** Enforces business rules (e.g., minimum/maximum fare limits, competitive matching).
  - **PricingController:** Exposes APIs for fare requests.
- **Interactions:** Communicates with Forecasting Service for demand data; integrates with external Pricing Tools.

#### Forecasting Service
- **Role:** Predict future demand and load factors.
- **Components:**
  - **ForecastModel:** Implements statistical and ML-based forecasting.
  - **ModelTrainer:** Batch training/updating of forecast models.
  - **ForecastController:** Provides APIs to fetch forecasts and trigger retraining.
- **Interactions:** Feeds data into the Pricing Service; may use data from PROS O&D.

#### Ancillary Service
- **Role:** Manage and personalize ancillary product bundling.
- **Components:**
  - **BundlingEngine:** Dynamically creates bundles (e.g., extra baggage, seat upgrades).
  - **Personalization Module:** Customizes offers based on user profiles.
  - **AncillaryController:** APIs for retrieving ancillary options.
- **Interactions:** Integrates with Pricing and Offer Management Services.

#### Offer Management Service
- **Role:** Assemble complete travel offers by combining base fares with ancillary options.
- **Components:**
  - **OfferAssembler:** Merges fare data and ancillary bundles.
  - **PersonalizationEngine:** Adjusts offers based on user data.
  - **OfferController:** Exposes APIs to retrieve personalized offers.
- **Interactions:** Receives data from Pricing, Ancillary, and Forecasting Services.

#### Integration Services
- **Role:** Connect DFAE with external systems (Amadeus PSS, PROS O&D, Pricing Tools, Network Planning).
- **Components:**
  - **API Adapters:** Convert external data to internal formats.
  - **Data Validators:** Ensure data quality and consistency.
  - **Error Handlers:** Automate retries and fallbacks.
- **Interactions:** Feed data into core services; use asynchronous messaging where needed.

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous:** REST/gRPC calls for immediate data exchange.
- **Asynchronous:** Event-driven messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for background processing and updates.

### Monitoring & Health
Each microservice exposes health and metrics endpoints for continuous automated monitoring and immediate issue resolution.

*Note:* All microservices have been designed with extensive automated testing, CI/CD integration, and are containerized for deployment in Kubernetes.
