## Network Planning & Codeshare Service
This service synchronizes schedule changes and codeshare partner flight data. It ingests new route plans, flight schedules, and partner codeshare information, ensuring the systemâ€™s data on flight availability and partnerships is current.

### Responsibilities
- **ScheduleImporter.py:** Fetches and processes updated flight schedules (new flights, cancellations, capacity changes).
- **PartnerSync.py:** Handles data from codeshare partners, including joint fare agreements and partner flight availability.
- **Integration:** Updates internal databases with new schedule and codeshare data.

### How to Use
- Run scheduled jobs to periodically update flight schedules and codeshare data.
- API endpoints (if exposed) allow retrieval of current network planning information.
- Configure using `config.yaml`, and containerize with the provided `Dockerfile`.
