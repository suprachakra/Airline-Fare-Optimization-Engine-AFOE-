BundlingEngine.py

Core logic to create dynamic ancillary bundles.
This module implements the dynamic bundling strategy as defined in
docs/product/Ancillary_Services_PRD.md, including rules for family, business, and standard bundles.

Key actions:
- Retrieve available ancillary items from flight data.
- Evaluate passenger profiles (e.g., travel type, loyalty status).
- Apply bundling rules and calculate discounts.

Business impact:
- Aims to increase ancillary revenue by 10â€“15%.
- Enhances customer satisfaction by delivering tailored offers.
